I'd like to share my custom-built vocabulary trainer shiny app!

What I did is upload a list of words in Turkish and German to Googlesheets and use this list as database. The shinyapp randomly pulls words from the list and remembers if I knew them or not (based on my input). This information is also stored in the Googlesheets. Depending how often you remembered a given words, this words will be stored in certain 'boxes'. Each word starts out in box 5 and moves down until box 1. Usually I only practice boxes 4 and 5 and only rarely check out the other ones.

The Excel file should contain the following columns:

original language

translation

optional: Lesson number (e.g. if you use a course book to learn the language)

Index

Box

Count (counts how often the app has shown you this word)

CountR (how often did you know it)



I hope someone can find some use in this!
Have fun!
